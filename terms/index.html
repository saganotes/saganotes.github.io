                    <h1>Terms and Conditions ("Terms")</h1>
                    <p>Last updated: October 1, 2019</p>
                    <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the Saga Notes mobile application (the "Service") operated by Backtick Labs GmbH ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
                    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
                    <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>
                    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
                    <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
                    <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Backtick Labs GmbH cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Backtick Labs GmbH customer support team.</p>
                    <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Backtick Labs GmbH with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Backtick Labs GmbH to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
                    <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Backtick Labs GmbH will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
                    <h2>Free Trial</h2>
                    <p>Backtick Labs GmbH may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").</p>
                    <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
                    <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Backtick Labs GmbH until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
                    <p>At any time and without notice, Backtick Labs GmbH reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
                    <h2>Fee Changes</h2>
                    <p>Backtick Labs GmbH, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
                    <p>Backtick Labs GmbH will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
                    <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
                    <h2>Refunds</h2>
                    <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>
                    <h2>Accounts</h2>
                    <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>
                    <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.</p>
                    <p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
                    <p>You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trade mark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you without appropriate authorization, or a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene.</p>

                    <p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
                    <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>
                    <h2>Limitation Of Liability</h2>
                    <p>In no event shall Backtick Labs GmbH, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>
